To start go to the folder and run: python gui.py

Select the picture or gif you want to convert in the import button.

The export button will be the location of the result file.

Also, please create 3 folders in the same directory of those 2 python files:
  gif_frame
  gif_frame_text
  to_image 
for converting a gif file. 

If you choose the simple mode the result gif will show you clearly how the ASCII move around, 
however the quality of the picture will not be so good. The detail mode will give you a better 
quality but you could not see the ASCII character.

The camera conversion is still a work in process.
